I recently spoke at [Devoxx UK](https://www.devoxx.co.uk/speaker-details/?id=9452) about how you can grow, both personally and professionally, through being involved in communities.
It was in the form of an [Ignite talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignite_(event)) which was great fun but I realised that there were a few slides that felt a little lightweight compared to others.

Writing the talk up as a blog post will hopefully help me to fill out the lighter parts, as well as maybe make it suitable for a longer length talk at some point in the future.

There are a few defintions of what a community is but for the purposes of this post the one that resonates with me most is this...

> the condition of sharing or having certain attitudes and interests in common.

The word community has evolved from the word common and this is key.
The idea of a community is that the poeple involved in it have something in common, whether that's beliefs, ideas, attitudes or interests.

Communities are important to us as people as they give us a sense of belonging.

Finding other people with things in common to us is part of human nature.

Communities help us to meet and connect with others who share our interests and provide a safe space for us to grow.

There are many different kinds of communities exist so here are a few that relate most closely to my experiences working in tech.

For me, the most important community is the one at home.

My family are the foundations of what make it possible for me to be a success in both my personal life and at work.
They provide support and a basic sense of security that give me the space to grow and succeed.

When you do fail, which will happen from time to time, I can always rely on them to pick me up and give me the motivation to go again.

In a professional context, the first community that comes to mind is your team.

These are the people who you work with day-to-day and share the same business priorities with.
You'll often have aligned ideas and principles about how you believe work should be done.

You will also disgraee on things and that's ok.

You'll collaborate with your team in various ways through things like coaching and pairing, or even socialising outside of work.

![organisation](/assets/grow-yourself-through-communities/organisation.png){:class="img-responsive"}

If you look wider than your immediate team within your organisation there are usually multiple commnities that are active at any one time.

Some examples are guilds focused on things like sustainability and LGBT+.
Other examples are groups focused on personal development & knowledge sharing such as an early careers network or a tech talk community.
