My background is with Java and object oriented (OO) approaches to software engineering however for the last 6 months
I've been building server side apps written in TypeScript and deployed to NodeJS.

I've never really ventured into the JavaScript ecosystem in the past, remaining in my comfort zone of the JVM and
statically typed languages. The emergence of TypeScript a few years ago piqued my interest so I was enthusiastic when
the opportunity to step out of my comfort zone came up.
