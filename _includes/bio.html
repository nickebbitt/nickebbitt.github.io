<p>Software development is my passion, particularly the processes involved in delivering change. The ability to regularly deliver value in a controlled, automated fashion is central to the way I work.</p>
<p>I love writing code with core strengths in Object Oriented languages (Java) and relational databases (Oracle). I'm comfortable with the design and architecture of complex systems.</p>
<p>Quality of software is very important to me. I utilise suitable tools & techniques to implement various flavours of tests. I believe that testing is a core part of the developers role and should be valued highly.</p>
<p>The latest technologies and techniques for delivering software excite me. At the same time I respect existing software systems, the challenges they present and the value they provide to a business.</p>
<p>I view team culture as a key element to successful software delivery. I make it a responsibility of mine to help to nurture a positive team environment where safety, quality and continuous improvement are highly valued.</p>
